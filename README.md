## 🐱 Abstract
<font color="red">MovieBench</font> is a Hierarchical Movie-Level Dataset for Long Video Generation, which addresses these challenges by providing unique contributions:
(1) movie-length videos featuring rich, coherent storylines and multi-scene narratives, (2) consistency of character appearance and audio across scenes, and (3) hierarchical data structure contains high-level movie information and detailed shot-level descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that MovieBench brings some new insights and challenges, such as maintaining character ID consistency across multiple scenes for various characters. The dataset will be public and continuously maintained, aiming
to advance the field of long video generation.
