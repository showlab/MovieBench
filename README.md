## üê± Abstract

**MovieBench** is a hierarchical dataset designed for advancing research in **long video generation**. It addresses the challenges associated with generating coherent, movie-length videos by providing a dataset that includes:  
1. **Rich, coherent storylines and multi-scene narratives**, capturing the essence of movie-level storytelling.  
2. **Consistency of character appearance and audio** across scenes, enabling character-focused generation.  
3. **Hierarchical data structure**, featuring both high-level movie information and detailed shot-level descriptions for fine-grained analysis.  

This dataset aims to inspire new research directions and tackle challenges such as maintaining **character ID consistency** across multiple scenes for various characters.

## Key Features  
- **Movie-Length Video Descriptions**: Comprehensive descriptions capturing scene transitions and narrative coherence.  
- **Character Bank**: Includes detailed information on character identities, roles, and visual/audio consistency across scenes.  
- **Shot-Level Details**: Fine-grained descriptions for each shot, including visual and narrative cues.  
- **Open Access and Continuous Updates**: The dataset is publicly available and will be regularly updated to include more diverse content and refined annotations.

## ‚è¨ Shot-Level Annotation Generation with GPT4

We developed our Shot-Level Annotation Generation system based on [MovieSeq](https://github.com/showlab/MovieSeq), leveraging GPT-4 to enhance its functionality.


<img src="asset/22.02.56.png" alt="image description" width="500" height="300" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">


Using a Visual Language Model (e.g., GPT-4), you can generate detailed annotations that include the following elements:
```
{
    "Characters":
    {
        "Character Name 1": "Description for appearance and behavior of Character 1, within 30 words",
        "Character Name 2": "Description for appearance and behavior of Character 2, within 30 words", 
    },
    "Style Elements":
    [
        "Element 1", "Element 2", "Element 3"
    ],
    "Plot":"A concise summary focusing on the main event or emotion, within 80 words",
    "Background Description":"A concise summary focusing on the main event or emotion, within 40 words",
    "Camera Motion":"A concise summary focusing camera motion, within 30 words."
}
```
